# logspec

`logspec` is a library that allows developers to verify their logging. This library is inspired by the [glager](https://github.com/st3v/glager)
library.

## Why?

When your application goes wrong in production, the first thing we turn to is our logs. However, most of us never test
our logs, and do not pay any attention to it until we start looking at the production logs and find that it gives us very
little information of value.

As a result, it makes sense for us to treat our logs as a first class feature and test it.



## Usage

Using `logspec` in your Scala project is quite simple.
